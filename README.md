# PHPTMAPI 3

PHPTMAPI 3 is the succession project of http://phptmapi.sourceforge.net/ 

PHPTMAPI is a PHP5 API for creating and manipulating topic maps, based on the http://tmapi.sourceforge.net/ project.
This API enables PHP developers an easy and standardized implementation of ISO/IEC 13250 Topic Maps in their applications.

## What is TMAPI?

TMAPI is a programming interface for accessing and manipulating data held in a topic map. The TMAPI specification defines a set of core interfaces which must be implemented by a compliant application as well as (eventually) a set of additional interfaces which may be implemented by a compliant application or which may be built upon the core interfaces. 

## Design Objectives in PHPTMAPI 3
* Do not change the  API
* Introduce namespaces
* Follow [PSR-0](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/) (autoloading standard), [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) (basic coding standard), and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) (coding style guide)
* Install via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and get autoloading for free

## Fetch and Install

Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and get autoloading for free.

Create a `composer.json` for your project:

```JSON
{
    "require": {
