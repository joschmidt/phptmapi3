# PHPTMAPI 3

PHPTMAPI 3 is the succession project of http://phptmapi.sourceforge.net/ 

PHPTMAPI is a PHP5 API for creating and manipulating topic maps, based on the http://tmapi.sourceforge.net/ project.
This API enables PHP developers an easy and standardized implementation of ISO/IEC 13250 Topic Maps in their applications.

## What is TMAPI?

TMAPI is a programming interface for accessing and manipulating data held in a topic map. The TMAPI specification defines a set of core interfaces which must be implemented by a compliant application as well as (eventually) a set of additional interfaces which may be implemented by a compliant application or which may be built upon the core interfaces.
